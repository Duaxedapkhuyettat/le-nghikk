			<h2>Okka's Philosophy of 'No Brand Quality Goods'</h2>
			<div class="about__div1">
				<p>Okka, a Vietnamese keyboard brand born in 2022, stands out from the crowd with its focus on sustainability and longevity. It emerged as a response to the ever-growing trend of excessive consumerism, where products are designed to be quickly replaced. Okka prioritizes crafting keyboards built to last, utilizing eco-friendly materials throughout the manufacturing process. Our meticulous approach involves rigorous selection and implementation of sustainable materials, ensuring that quality and affordability are not compromised. This commitment to environmental responsibility, along with a dedication to long-lasting design, positions Okka as a refreshing alternative for those seeking a keyboard that is as kind to the planet as it is to your wallet.</p>

			<h2>Simplifying Packaging</h2>
			<div class="about__div2">
				<img src="image/packaging.jpg" alt="Packaging"3 width="4298" height="4298" class="img-100">
				<p>When packaging products, Okka seeks not to adorn them but rather to highlight their natural colors and shapes. For this reason, we use bulk packaging and place products in plain, uniform containers. Faithful to our philosophy of simplicity, this approach is also in keeping with our policy of conserving resources and reducing waste. Thus, all Okka products appear on store shelves in simple packaging bearing only product-related information and a price tag. Okka is not a brand whose value rests in the frills and “extras” it adds to its products.Okka is simplicity - but a simplicity achieved through a complexity of thought and design. Okka's streamlining is the result of the careful elimination and subtraction of gratuitous features and design unrelated to function. Okka, the brand, is rational, and free of agenda, doctrine, and “isms.” The Okka concept derives from us continuously asking, “What is best from an end user's point of view?” Okka aspires to modesty and plainness, the better to adapt and shape itself to the styles, preferences, and practices of as wide a group of people as possible. This is the single most important reason people embrace Okka. Okka – in its deliberate pursuit of the pure and the ordinary – achieves the extraordinary.</p>

				<h2>Selection of Materials</h2>
				<p>For Okka, the materials we use to make such products are of the utmost importance; consequently, considerable attention is given to their selection. We search worldwide for the most suitable raw materials. We use many industrial materials as well as materials discarded by others because of their appearance. The overriding selection criteria is always quality. These activities underpin our ability to create low-priced, high-quality products.</p>

				<h2>Streamlining Processes</h2>
				<p>The processes by which each product is manufactured are subjected to careful scrutiny at Okka. Processes that have no bearing on a product’s quality such as sorting, sizing, and polishing are eliminated, leaving only these processes that are truly necessary. Even items that have been discarded because they do not meet certain standards of size and appearance are turned into products for sale. Focusing on true quality, Okka's manufacturing processes eliminate waste and reduce costs.</p>
